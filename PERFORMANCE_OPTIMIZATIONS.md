# Frontend Performance Optimizations

This document outlines all the performance optimizations implemented in the frontend application.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The frontend has been comprehensively optimized for performance, user experience, and maintainability. These optimizations work in conjunction with the backend database optimizations to provide a fast, responsive application.

## ðŸ“Š Performance Monitoring System

### 1. Performance Monitoring Service (`services/performance.js`)

**Features:**
- Real-time performance tracking for API calls, component renders, and user interactions
- Automatic batching and transmission of metrics to backend
- Session-based tracking with unique session IDs
- Configurable thresholds and automatic flushing

**Usage:**
```javascript
import { usePerformanceTracking } from '@/services/performance'

const { trackApiCall, trackComponentRender, trackUserInteraction } = usePerformanceTracking()

// Track API call
trackApiCall('get_files', startTime, { fileCount: 100 })

// Track component render
trackComponentRender('FileBrowser', startTime, { itemCount: 500 })

// Track user interaction
trackUserInteraction('file_selection', startTime, { selectedCount: 5 })
```

### 2. Performance Dashboard (`components/Admin/PerformanceDashboard.vue`)

**Features:**
- Real-
