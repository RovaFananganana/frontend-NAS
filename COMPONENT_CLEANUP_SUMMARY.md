**Branch:** component-cleanup  
**Total Cleanup Duration:** Multiple iterations across tasks 1-7

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed comprehensive component cleanup of the Vue.js frontend application, removing unused components, consolidating duplicates, and fixing import issues. The cleanup resulted in a cleaner codebase structure and improved maintainability.

## Components Removed

### Unused Components (6 files removed)
1. **`FileExplorerNas.vue`** (Admin directory)

   - **Impact:** Safe removal, functionality covered by other components

### Duplicate Components Consolidated (3 files removed)
4. **`CreateFolderModal.vue`** (Admin directory)
   - **Reason:** Duplicate of Shared/CreateFolderModal.vue
   - **Analysis:** Identical functionality, consolidated to Shared version

## Import Issues Fixed

### Naming Inconsistencies Resolved
